(** {2 Searching for illegal name occurrences} *)

(** Type of a function that takes a term, and generates
    a list of its name occurrences.
    Also returns a list of [('a, 'b) simple_occs], used to record
    information gathered during the exploration of the term
    (the additional data field can be used to record anything,
     e.g. {b TODO}).

    Uses:
    - A continuation of type [unit -> n_occs * 'a, 'b simple_occs]
      when it does not want to handle the term it's given,
      and just asks to be called again on the subterms.
    - A continuation of type
      [fv -> cond -> p -> se -> st -> term -> n_occs * ('a,'b) simple_occs]
      that calls the function again on the given parameters,
      for when it needs to do finer things
      (typically handle some of the subterms manually,
       and call this continuation on the remaining ones,
       or handle subterms at depth 1 by hand,
       and call the continuation on subterms at depth 2).
      Functions of this type don't need to unfold macros,
      which are handled separately.

    Other parameters:
    - [info]: information to expand macros,
      including system at current position.
    - [fv]: variables bound above the current position.
    - [cond]: condition at the current position.
    - [p]: current position.
    - [st]: a surrounding subterm, for printing purposes. *)

    "a bad name occurrence happens" and
